## Context

The purpose of this model is to get a sense of what your financial profit/loss outcomes may look like under a range of scenarios for the Redacted Cartel token, BTRFLY.			

The model was built around the time that the [tapering period](https://commonwealth.im/redacted-cartel/discussion/3617-rff-the-road-to-redacted-v2) started, ~1 Feb 2022, where the APY for inflation will be adjusted from 80,000% to 1,000%, over an 80-day period.

## Instructions					

You can change the values in blue highlight to suit the conditions prevalent at the time you decide to enter a position e.g. price of BTRFLY, amount invested, etc.					

To understand what your outcomes might be, refer to the tables in the "Sensitivities" section.					

## Disclaimer / Notice			
This model was built for personal research & learning. It was done on a "quick and dirty" basis, and hasn't been checked in detail. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!			
Model format and other conventions were carried over from my time in finance; if anything should be explained better, please do let me know.			

## Potential enhancements
* Sensitivity for change in value of tokens in reserve. E.g. CRV and CVX could rise/fall. Currently the model assumes the reserve's value does not change apart from new contributions (new bonding).					
* Risk metrics (composition of reserves, price history, comparison to similar rebase / POL projects like Olympus and bribe wars projects).
* I welcome feedback and suggestions. DM me at Twitter @88crypt.
