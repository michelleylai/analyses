# AMM simulation + visualization

I found AMM math not very intuitive for the non-academic user. I created a spreadsheet to simulate what happens to the pool when you swap assets or add liquidity (link below). The fields are adjustable so you can play around with numbers to see their impact on the pool.

Sushiswap (equiv to Uniswap v2) is the first example (first tab). It uses the "constant product" formula to price a trade; in English, "the product of the quantities of X and Y remains constant when a trade is made." When you swap X for Y, the price you get isn't the exact ratio of X:Y you see in the pool (e.g. if there is 1 ETH and 3000 DAI in a pool, you don't get 1 ETH for 3000 DAI). You always get an inferior price, because price slips down (or up, depending on your perspective) along a curve. The curve is defined by the function Y = k / X (or, k = X * Y, i.e. constant product). See the curve chart in the spreadsheet for reference. 

When you add liquidity, however, "constant product" doesn't apply. The whole curve shift outwards, so the k in k = X * Y changes.

On the second tab, we look at Balancer. Balancer is known for using "constant weighted-product." In English, "the product of the quantities of X and Y, each weighted by a pre-determined exponent (power), remains constant when a trade is made." k = (quantity of A ^ chosen weight of A) * (quantity of B ^ chosen weight of B).

Another distinction between Sushiswap and Balancer (in their current forms) is the value of each token in a pool. In Sushiswap (or Uniswap v2), each token comprises 50% of the value fo the pool (and if it doesn't, it represents a price arbitrage opportunity and arbitrageurs will bring it in line with external market prices until the pool halves are equal again). This is equivalent in function to the weight of each token being 0.5.

Balancer's weighting for pools means that each token comprises a different % of value in the pool (not 50% each). This results in a curve of assets (~ a pricing curve) that is shaped differently.

THe different shape of curves results in different levels of slippage and tendency for "impermanent loss" (which is really just unrealized loss, in tradfi terms).
