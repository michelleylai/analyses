# Leveraged trades: playing around with collateral and exposure values

I want to buy some crypto and use leverage for the trade. 

Since my collateral and exposure values are flexible, I want to get a sense of what scenarios are appealing + palatable to me. 

I created two different models:
1. Model 1: Assuming a certain level of collateral, how much exposure could i get, with different leverage options (2x to 5x)?
2. Model 2: Assuming I want a certain level of exposure, how much collateral do I need to deposit, for different leverage options?

Here are the outcome I want to track:
* What are the return outcomes? 
* If price moves in the wrong direction, when should I start depositing more collateral? How large of a top up do I need to make at different prices?
